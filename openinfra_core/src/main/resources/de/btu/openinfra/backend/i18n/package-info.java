/**
 * This package contains language files (curretly German and English). Language
 * files are hierarchical. The main file would be: openinfra.properties
 * the next level would be openinfra_de.properties for German and 
 * openinfra_en.properties for English. The next level as used here defines
 * the language as well as country directly. In order to provide a default
 * language file which works for any unknown language use a main file:
 * openinfra_de.properties
