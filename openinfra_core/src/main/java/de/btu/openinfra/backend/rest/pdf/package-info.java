/**
 * This package contains REST resources for PDF transformation. Therefore,
 * already existing XML resources are used to generate the wanted PDF results.
 * The layout of the PDF output is based on XSL-FO and can be adapted by
 * changing related XSLT files. These files are in the resources folder.
